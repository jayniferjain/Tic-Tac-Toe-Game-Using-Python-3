# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-Using-Python-3
This is a basic Tic-tac-toe game, which is developed using Python 3 on Jupyter-Notebook platform

Here are the requirements:
  -> 2 players should be able to play the game (both sitting at the same computer).
  -> The board should be printed out every time a player makes a move.

You should be able to accept input of the player position and then place a symbol on the board.
Feel free to use Google to help you figure anything out (but don't just Google "Tic Tac Toe in Python" otherwise you won't learn anything!)
